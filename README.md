## 🌾 CropSense – AI & IoT Based Smart Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Description

CropSense is an **AI and IoT-based agriculture decision support system** that helps farmers choose the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions.

The system uses **IoT sensors to collect real-time field data**, which is then processed by a **machine learning model** to recommend the most suitable crop. The system also provides information such as sowing time, growth duration, fertilizer recommendations, and estimated fertilizer cost.

The project integrates **hardware sensors, machine learning models, and a web interface** to provide a complete smart farming solution.

## ✨ Features

* 🌱 AI-based crop recommendation
* 📡 Real-time data collection using IoT sensors
* 🌍 Soil and environmental parameter analysis
* 💊 Fertilizer recommendation

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository

```id="6ru85y"
git clone https://github.com/brindha4999/CropSense.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```id="jnszzv"
cd cropsense
```

3. Install required dependencies

```id="f48h0c"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Running the Project

### Step 1 – Run Backend Server

```id="qfypxz"
python backend.py
```

This starts the Flask server.


### Step 2 – Open Frontend

Open:

```id="3v6m1q"
frontend.html
```

in your web browser.


### Step 3 – Sensor Data Collection (Hardware)

IoT sensors collect field parameters such as:

* Soil nutrients
* Soil moisture
* Temperature
* Humidity

These values can be transmitted to the system and used as input for the crop recommendation model.

## 🌍 Impact

CropSense helps farmers make **data-driven farming decisions** by combining **AI and IoT technologies**. This improves crop productivity, reduces resource wastage, and supports sustainable agriculture.
